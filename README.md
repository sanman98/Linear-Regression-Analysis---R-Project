# Linear Regression Analysis - R Project  
*Introduction to Data Science Course - University of Jeddah*

This project was developed as part of the **Introduction to Data Science** course at the University of Jeddah.  
We used the **R programming language** to analyze the relationship between **temperature** and **ozone levels** using the built-in **`airquality`** dataset.
